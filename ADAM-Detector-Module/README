                                   WLS
                                ----------

  This application simulates the propagation of optical photons in the ADAM detector module. The detector module consists of 
  scintillating panels, Wave Length Shifting (WLS) fiber, Silicon Photomultipliers as optical components for detection of optical
  photons generated by high energy muon passing through the detector.


  This program uses the General Particle Source (G4GeneralParticleSource) 
  provided by Geant4 for generating particles. 

  A hit is registered when an optical photon is absorbed on the MPPC
  surface.  Information stored in a hit includes the local coordinate of the
  location the optical photon is absorbed on the MPPC, the global coordinate
  where the optical photon left the fiber, the transit time of the optical
  photon, and the energy of the optical photon.

  The stepping action keeps track of the number of bounces an optical photon has
  gone through.  In order to prevent infinite loop and extremely skewed
  rays taking up computing time, there is a limit of the number of
  bounces that an optical photon can go through before it is artificially killed.
  The default limit is 100,000.  The user can set his/her own limit using
  the /stepping/setBounceLimit command.  A value of 0 will turn off the
  limit.  All optical photons artificially killed will have murderee flag turned
  on in their UserTrackInformation.

  To visualize particle trajectories, simply use vis.mac macro in
  interactive mode or in your own macro.


 - execute wls in 'batch' mode from macro files
 - you can enter an optional integer seed for batch mode 
         % wls electron.mac (optional: enter an integer seed here)
                 
 - wls in 'interactive mode' with visualization
         % wls
         ....
         Idle> /control/execute
         Idle> /run/beamOn 1
         ....
         Idle> exit

 - electron.mac: Sets up the geometry and configures the particle source.
                 Primary particle is a 10 MeV electron.
 - vis.mac: macro for visualization; called automatically when no macro is
            given on command line.
