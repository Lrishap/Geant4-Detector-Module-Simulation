         Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
         =========================================================
Background:
A simple ADAM detector module simulation utilizing Geant4. A square scintillating panel of 1m is being considered as a detector module. 
4 Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) is mounted vertically as plugs with Wavelength Shifting (WLS) fibers coupled to them on the scintillating
panel. Different SiPM spacings (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 cm) is being considered. A 4 GeV muon is being shot at the center of the SiPM grid in the 
scintillating panel. The output is the number of photons reaching individual SiPMs during each event. The motivation behind counting the 
number of photons is to estimate the total charge in individual SiPMs during each event. The relative position of the SiPMs and the 
total charge at individual SiPMs is an input for muon event interaction position estimation using the Squared Charge Centroiding Algorithm.
